The Rainbow


MY heart leaps up when I behold	 
A rainbow in the sky:	 
So was it when my life began;	 
So is it now I am a man;	 
So be it when I shall grow old,	         
      Or let me die!	 
The Child is father of the Man;	 
I could wish my days to be	 
Bound each to each by natural piety.

Over The Rainbow - Poem by Sulaiman Mohd Yusof

The morning rays of the Sun cling
On the upper bow of the Rainbow
Emerge after a moment ‘s dusk
Brown Pelicans and Western Gulls
Fly beneath the lower bow
That touches the water
Send fishes into hiding

As I walk along the white beach
Looking at the sea, the blue waters
Dance its way towards the golden sand
Shy away from the smiling horizon
Once, in a jubilant second, vessels across, 
Scream their hearts out, 
Ignite the nature’s garland
The Princess of the Sea, 
Colorful as Galaxies dust
Catches watchful eyes off-guard


The seven colors spectrum is the senses
Nourishes the need and desire
Like a prism, it passes through every heart
Leaving the lights of absolution
Windward and crystallize

Red, orange, yellow
Life and love bestows
Green, blue, indigo
Ships of love embargo
Engaged for passion
Violet
Rhymes like couplet
One kiss, 
Over the rainbow
Breaches the distance
Between friendship
And love 
Over The Rainbow
